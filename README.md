periodicity
===========

A project to represent the periodic table in various ways for various purposes.


Basically I'm playing around.


The current idea is to setup a client backend in PHP with Symfony, and store
the elements of the periodic table in Neo4j. I'll probably throw in some kind of
front end framework du jour like Vue to render the elements, and hopefully the
one cool thing I can do is write Cypher queries that form molecules from the
atoms.
